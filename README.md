# data-learning-lab-cr
My learning path in Python and SQL fundamentals, data analysis, and data science concepts - covering core programming, data manipulation, querying, and analytical workflows.


# Data Science and Python Practice

This repository contains **Python exercises and practice programs**, including introductory **Data Science** topics. 
It documents my learning journey in programming and data analysis.

The focus is on building strong foundations in Python while progressively incorporating **data-oriented analysis** through practical, hands-on exercises.


## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
* Build solid foundations in Python
* Develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Demonstrate my understanding of **Data Science concepts** using Python
* Track my learning progress and serve as a personal skills reference


## Repository Content

This repository includes exercises and examples related to:
### Python Fundamentals
* Input and output (`input`, `print`)
* Control flow and logic
* Script-based problem solving
**Example files:**
* `BusinessEmailAccount.py` – Demonstrates how user input can be used to generate a business email account


## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Terminal / Command Line
* Git and GitHub


## Planned Additions

The repository will continue to grow and include exercises and projects covering:

* `break` and `continue`
* `for` and `while` loops
* `if / elif / else` statements
* String manipulation
* Vowel eater exercise
* Block pyramid exercise
* Basic algorithms and programming logic
* Data analysis with `pandas`
* Use of libraries such as `numpy`
* Basic data visualization
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Small-scale Data Science projects


## Notes

This repository will continue to evolve as I progress in Python and Data Science.

All content is intended for **educational purposes** and personal documentation.
