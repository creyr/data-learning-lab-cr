# data-learning-lab-cr
My learning path in Python and SQL fundamentals, data analysis, and data science concepts - covering core programming, data manipulation, querying, and analytical workflows.

## Data Science and Python Practice

This repository contains **Python exercises and practice programs**, including introductory **Data Science** topics. 
It documents my learning journey in programming and data analysis.

The focus is on building strong foundations in Python while progressively incorporating **data-oriented analysis** through practical, hands-on exercises.


### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
* Build solid foundations in Python
* Develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Demonstrate my understanding of **Data Science concepts** using Python
* Track my learning progress and serve as a personal skills reference


### Repository Content

#### Business Email Account Generator
This repository also includes a Python script that demonstrates how a business email
account can be generated using basic user input.
The script receives personal information such as name and last name and creates
a standardized corporate email address based on predefined formatting rules.
This exercise focuses on:
- Working with user input
- String manipulation
- Basic programming logic
- Formatting structured outputs

⚠️ This implementation is for **educational purposes only** and represents a simplified
example of how business email accounts may be created in real-world applications.

#### CURP Generator (Educational)
In Mexico, the CURP (Clave Única de Registro de Población) is a unique identification code
assigned to every person living in the country.
This repository includes a Python script that demonstrates how a CURP can be generated
programmatically by following its basic structural rules.

⚠️ This implementation is **for educational purposes only** and does not replace
the official government process.


### Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Terminal / Command Line
* Git and GitHub


### Planned Additions

The repository will continue to grow and include exercises and projects covering:

* `break` and `continue`
* `for` and `while` loops
* `if / elif / else` statements
* String manipulation
* Vowel eater exercise
* Block pyramid exercise
* Basic algorithms and programming logic
* Data analysis with `pandas`
* Use of libraries such as `numpy`
* Basic data visualization
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Small-scale Data Science projects


### Notes

This repository will continue to evolve as I progress in Python and Data Science.

All content is intended for **educational purposes** and personal documentation.
